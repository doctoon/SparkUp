you might need to create other directories, such as:
/font - where all the font files are stored
/logs - where "restartLog.txt" is stored for the restart command (so the file can be edited so the script can re-run again due to some nodemon limitations.)
/node-modules - of course this is where the dependencies for discord.js and stuff go.
